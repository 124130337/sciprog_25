#Practical 8

This branch contains files for practical 8. There is one code to be run.

#Compiling the code

To compile the codes, do the following:

gcc -o gcd gcd.c

#Executing the code

To execute the code, do the following:

./gcc

#Output

The code will prompt the user to enter two postive integers, then the greatest common divisor of those two numbers using the iterative and recursive methods,

for example:

Please input two positive integers:
42
56
Iterative gcd(42, 56)=14
Recursive gcd(42, 56)=14
